2024-01-17 22:04:00,mdancho84,"Boxplots are one of the most useful tools in my Data Science arsenal. In  minutes, I'll teach you  years of using box plots for EDA and problem-solving. Let's dive in.  . What is a boxplot? A boxplot is a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on a five-number summary: minimum, first quartile (Q), median, third quartile (Q), and maximum.  . Invention: The boxplot was invented in  by John Tukey, as part of his pioneering work in data visualization. Tukey's EDA emphasized the importance of using simple graphical and numerical methods to start understanding the data before making any assumptions about its underlying distribution or applying complex statistical models. The boxplot emerged from this philosophy. Tukey's boxplot was designed to be a quick and easy way to visualize the distribution of data.  . Usage: I use boxplots during the exploratory phase. First, I assess correlations to an outcome I am interested in. Then I explore the top features during Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Boxplots are heavily used in my EDA.  . Key Features of Boxplots: In one quick visualization, boxplots display distribution summary, outliers, skewness, and it facilitates comparisons between multiple groups or categories.  . The Box: The box spans from the first quartile (Q) to the third quartile (Q). This range, known as the interquartile range (IQR), contains the middle  of the data. The line inside the box represents the median (the second quartile, Q), which divides the dataset into two equal halves.  . The Whiskers: The whiskers extend from the box to show the range of the data. A common approach is to extend them to the smallest and largest values within . times the IQR from the first and third quartiles, respectively. Data points outside this range are considered outliers and are sometimes plotted as individual points.  . Outliers: These are data points that lie beyond the end of the whiskers. They are not part of the bulk of the data and may indicate variability in the data, experimental errors, or novel findings. Explore these!  . Skewness: If the median is not equidistant from Q and Q, or if the whiskers are of unequal lengths, it suggests that the data is skewed.  . Key Issues: One issue I run into commonly is multimodal distributions (these are distributions with multiple ""humps"" like a camel's back). These usually indicate a group-wise pattern, which needs to be explored by group.    Theres a lot more to learning Data Science for Business. I'd like to help.   I put together a free on-demand workshop that covers the  skills that helped me make the transition to Data Scientist: https:learn.business-science.iofree-rtrack-masterclass?eltwitter  And if you'd like to speed it up, I have a live workshop where I'll share how to use ChatGPT for Data Science: https:learn.business-science.ioregistration-chatgpt-?eltwitter  If you like this post, please reshare  it so others can get value.",654,6

Sahar Rahmani could run rings around you all day if you both talked about cybersecurity, fraud prevention, and data science.  But that didn't stop her from feeling overwhelmed by the milk aisle on her first visit to a supermarket in Canada.  She ended up calling a friend to ask which milk brand was closest to what they had back home in Iran.  I had a similar experience... when I needed to buy Benylin, the cough expectorant.  It's humbling how the things we take for granted back in our home countries suddenly become tripwires as we go through the motions of settling into our new country as immigrants.  But thats not the only thing Sahar and I talk about. We also explore:  The importance of finding your community  Passing on the beauty of your culture to your kids  Her saddest moments as an immigrant in Canada  The one thing she would have done differently  The tradeoffs she has had to make and much more.

2024-01-16 17:14:00,mdancho84,"K-means is an essential algorithm for Data Science and Business. In  minutes learn what took me  weeks to figure out. Let's dive in.  . K-means is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering. It's a core algorithm used for customer segmentation, inventory categorization, market segmentation, and even anomaly detection.  . Unsupervised: K-means is an unsupervised algorithm that is used on data with no labels or predefined outcomes. The goal is not to predict a target output, but to explore the structure of the data by identifying patterns, clusters, or relationships within the dataset.  . Objective Function: The objective of K-means is to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS). It does this though a series of iterative steps that include Assignments and Updated Steps.  . Assignment Step: In this step, each data point is assigned to the nearest cluster centroid. The ""nearest"" is typically determined using the Euclidean distance.  . Update Step: Recalculate the centroids as the mean of all points in the cluster. Each centroid is the average of the points in its cluster.  . Iterate: The assignment and update steps are repeated until the centroids no longer change significantly, indicating that the clusters are as good as stable. This process minimizes the within-cluster variance.  . Key outputs: Cluster Centroids, Labels, and the Sum of Squared Distances. The centroids represent the mean location of all points in each cluster and are essential for interpreting the results of the clustering. The Labels are the cluster assignments. The Sum of Squared Distances is a measure of the distance that each point in the cluster is from the cluster centroid.  . Evaluation. There are several ways to evaluate K-Means.  common methods are Silhoutte Score and the Elbow Method.  . Silhouette Score: This metric measures how similar a data point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. The silhouette score ranges from - to , where a high value indicates that the data point is well-matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters.  . Elbow Method: This method involves plotting the inertia as a function of the number of clusters and looking for an 'elbow' in the graph. The elbow point, where the rate of decrease sharply changes, can be a good choice for the number of clusters.    Theres a lot more to learning Data Science for Business. Ready to start?

Ill enlighten you. Cuz dude I actually know how research  data collection work. I did  yrs of science research across  neuroscience labs during premed. Oh, and a  month project with my health economics teacher. Double majored w biology  economics. Also did cancer research w the chairman of pathology during medical school. Took stats in UG, Biostats in med school, and have tutored the damn thing too.  You truly believe the most liberal demographic is with you guys?! Yikes. As your results demonstrate, Its easy to get such ridiculous results. Your recipe?  () Confirmation bias: People like to be right. Confirmation bias occurs because people tend to ignore information thats contrary to their pre-existing thoughts. They seek out knowledge that just verifies their current thinking. The most common example of our age might be political discourse and how it plays out on social media. People are constantly cherry-picking information and seeking out data that confirms their perspectives.  () Selection Bias: Selection of individuals, groups, or data for analysis in such a way that proper randomization is not achieved, thereby failing to ensure that the sample obtained is REPRESENTATIVE of the GREATER POPULATION intended to be analyzed. () Observer Bias: This bias stems from the subjective viewpoint of observers and how they assess subjective criteria or record subjective information. Observer bias can be especially likely to occur if the conductor of a study has a desired outcome or preconception from the mentioned study. () Sampling Bias: Sampling bias refers to the collection of a biased sample caused by non-random sampling. () Statistical bias:  occurs when a statistic is unrepresentative of the population. Statistical bias describes any instance that creates a difference between an expected value and the true value of a population parameter being estimated. , , and  are examples of statistical bias. () Congruence Bias: This bias often shows up when practitioners are looking to confirm a causal relationship that they desire. Congruence bias is the tendency of people to over-rely on testing their initial hypothesis (the most congruent one) while neglecting to test alternative hypotheses. That is, people rarely try experiments that could disprove their initial belief, but rather try to repeat their initial results. It is a special case of the confirmation bias. They dont go looking for another explanation, like we polled anti-choice organization members instead of a randomized sample representative of the general population cuz they dont want it to be true.",1,0

The fact that womens choices have often been, and remain, limited by marriage and responsibility for the home and family is at the heart of her analyses and explanatory models. Goldins studies have also taught us that change takes time, because choices that affect entire careers are based on expectations that may later prove to be false.  Her insights reach far outside the borders of the US and similar patterns have been observed in many other countries. Her research brings us a better understanding of the labour markets of yesterday, today and tomorrow.  NobelPrize",5712,65

2024-01-17 21:24:00,forbidden322,"FROM JIM KEITH BOOK MASS CONTROL  Over the past fty years, enormous changes in law, medicine, science, and education have been wrought by Kinseys data which was Kinseys grand scheme from the beginning. The reason for a massive and extensive legal, educational, and political eort to continue the deception and suppress eorts to bring the full truth out in the open, is due to the enormity of the multidisciplinary sex edice in the United States and extending today worldwide through the United Nations. This edice stands four square upon the foundation of the false authority of Alfred Kinseys science, yet billions in government-funded programs dealing with sex, gender and human reproduction are advanced based upon the Kinsey false authority.   One spearhead launched by the Kinsey Institute was an encounter group called Sexual Attitude Technique, which trained at least , people beginning in the early s. Writing in Esquire magazine, George Leonard reported his SAR experience:  The sensory overload culminated on Saturday night in a multi-media event called the F-korama...in the darkness... images of human beingsand sometimes even animals engaging in every conceivable sexual act, accompanied by wails, squeals, moans, shouts and the rst movement of the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto. Some seventeen simultaneous moving pictures... Over a period of several hours, there came a moment when the four images on the wall were of a gay male couple, a straight couple, a lesbian couple, and a bestial group. The subjects were nude... I felt myself becoming disoriented...was she kissing a man or a woman? I struggled to force the acts I was watching into their proper boxes...and now I couldnt remember which was which. Wasnt I supposed to make these discriminations? I searched for clues. There were none. I began to feel uncomfortable. Soon I realized that to avoid vertigo and nausea I would have to give up the attempt to discriminate and simply surrender to the experience... The dierences for which lives have been ruined, were not only trivial, but invisible. By the end... Nothing was shocking... But nothing was sacred either. But as I drove home, I began to get a slightly uneasy feeling. It was almost as if I had been conned...by my own conditioned response of taking the most liberated position...whatever my deeper feelings...love had not been mentioned a single time during the entire weekend.   Another of Kinseys accomplishments was to force the courts, through dint of the normalcy of what had hitherto been thought of as perverse, to lessen penalties for illegal sex acts, and to normalize homosexuality in the military.  With Kinsey, American mores were almost completely warped, to the point where almost any sexual act is now acceptable. Wife swapping, easy divorce, swinging, the depiction of sex acts in the media, homosexuality, and sadomasochism are promoted as the norm.  As with most actions of the social engineers, there are a number of reasons for this.   One is the creation of what has been called a sen-sate society, satiated with sex, drugs, and TV (the modern form of bread and circuses, so that no challenge is ever mounted to the controllers by a numbed electorate.   Another reason for this is the decoupling of sex from procreation, thus making the instituting of sterilization and birth control policies including abortion more easily instituted upon the masses.   Another purpose is the destruction of the nuclear family, opening the door for greater societal intervention and manipulation.  mindcontrol sexualizingchildren pedo PedoGovernment conspiracies GreatReset EngineeringHumanConsciousness JeffreyEpstein PedoGate DepopulationAgenda depopulation BillGates SexTrafficking HumanTrafficking",0,0

2024-01-17 19:07:00,luxspacescience," Introduction to Solar Observation Data Analysis  The final publication of the series where we convey the analysis of astrophysical topics and the principles of real-time application has been shared.  In the first stage of this published project, we discussed how to access solar observation data and satellite images, and how to interactively analyze them.  ""Solar Image Observation and Analysis"" involves capturing and studying images of the Sun to explore its properties and activities. Key tools include ground-based telescopes and space-based observatories like SOHO, SDO, and the Parker Solar Probe. These instruments capture images in visible, ultraviolet, and X-ray spectra, contributing to solar physics and space weather research.  Different wavelengths expose various aspects of the Sun. UV and X-ray images unveil the dynamic outer atmosphere (corona), while visible light emphasizes sunspots and surface features. Advanced telescopes offer high-resolution views, enabling detailed observations of solar flares, sunspots, and coronal mass ejections (CMEs).  Scientists analyze sunspots, solar flares, filament eruptions, and CMEs to comprehend the Sun's magnetic field, plasma dynamics, and energy transfer. They study the solar spectrum for insights into its composition, temperature, and physical properties, using spectroscopy to identify elements and ionization states in the solar atmosphere.  You can access the project, where you can examine the first step of these approaches, via this link: https:lnkd.indMFYBZDk  Considering the period of our star, we underline that it is necessary to attach importance to experimental studies in this field.  NASA - National Aeronautics and Space Administration's observation satellites and instruments were preferred in this data analysis.   The image below is a real-time satellite analysis visual that we obtained from the code study we published.  Lets Lift-off !

2024-01-17 17:45:00,omarsar0,"RAG vs. Fine-Tuning  Cool report discussing the tradeoff between RAG and fine-tuning when using LLMs like Llama  and GPT-.   It performs a detailed analysis and highlights insights when applying the pipelines on an agricultural dataset.   Here is a figure showing the pipeline used in this study:  Here is a summary of the comparison between RAG and fine-tuning results:  Findings:  The authors observe that there is an ""accuracy increase of over  p.p. when fine-tuning the model and this is cumulative with RAG, which increases accuracy by  p.p. further.""   They also ""demonstrate that the fine-tuned model leverages information from across geographies to answer specific questions, increasing answer similarity from  to .""  RAG is effective where data is contextually relevant such as interpretation of farm data. However, it might significantly increase the prompt size and become harder to steer.   Fine-tuning, on the other hand, could be tuned for brevity and can incur less cost (i.e., necessitates minimal input token size) when dealing with large datasets. The challenge is the initial cost and effort required to fine-tune models on new data.  Overall, the suitability of each approach depends on the specific application, the nature and size of the data, and available resources for model development.   As suggested by many other reports, there is also the possibility of combining the two approaches. I also agree with the authors that it would be interesting to combine structured information from PDFs with images and captions to enable multi-modal fine-tuning opportunities.",1205,7

The issue here is that there is no comparison with those who were infected and under vaccinated.  There is alternative data that is more nuanced than this, see, Uuskla et al.,   Uuskla et al., showed that natural immunity was also effective in specific waves. But my point is that you cherry picked info from the paper you cite, and failed to mention the issues with the paper, and there are numerous issues with the claims being made. It is tedious seeing so many (predominantly men  with some sort of title) presenting studies to people as though they are fact, in full knowledge you would never get away with this in an academic or professional setting.   Just pretty unpleasant to see it.. there is not need for anyone to do this. You can just as easily present a paper and explain the pros and cons.

Amnesty International, the International Centre of Justice for Palestinians and the Palestinian Ambassador to the UK all provided powerful testimony to a packed meeting.  It is clear that our Government should be doing everything in its powers right now to help prevent any war crimes being committed and to hold those perpetrating such crimes to account.  But its repeated failure to demand an immediate ceasefire is giving the green light to Israel to act in clear violation of international law.  We believe that we all have a responsibility to do all we can to prevent war crimes and to hold those perpetrating such crimes to account.  So over the coming weeks, we will be holding further meetings with legal experts and human rights experts to inform MPs, to shine a light on war crimes in Parliament and to add to the pressure on our government to speak out and finally demand an immediate ceasefire and that justice be done.",2786,816

2023-12-14 13:33:00,ucddublin," Met ireann partners with UCD on new AI research programme for weather and climate services   A new multi-million-euro research programme supporting the further development of weather and climate services using data science and AI has been announced between University College Dublin and Met ireann, the Irish National Meteorological Service.  This new partnership aims to develop AI-enhanced models that will enable Met ireann to build on its forecasting capabilities and make Ireland even more weather and climate prepared.  Working closely with an expert knowledge transfer team at Met ireann and a research group from the UCD School of Mathematics and Statistics and UCD Earth Institute, the Met ireann Weather and Climate Research Professorship will incorporate a  million annual investment for an initial period of five years.  The project has been set up to bridge the gap between research and operations by examining the context of high-impact weather, flood forecasting, and the understanding of Ireland's climate.  UCD and Met ireann have a long-standing relationship in working together to enhance weather forecasting, said (opens in a new window)Professor Helen Roche, UCDs Interim Vice-President for Research, Impact and Innovation.  By harnessing the power of AI to support the protection of life, property and infrastructure, this partnership takes that relationship to the next level.  UCD's world-leading experts in this dynamic field are conceiving and evolving creative solutions that impact all of society and our daily life.  ""[Our] researchers will help develop AI-enhanced models to enable Met ireann to build on its forecasting capabilities and make Ireland even more weather and climate prepared.  Adding: This ground-breaking partnership between UCD and Met ireann will help produce the next generation of climate and weather scientists and help ensure that we have the tools and expertise needed to tackle the climate emergency.  A direct response to climate change, the overarching objectives of the new collaboration will focus on enhancing citizen safety, bolstering economic and environmental resilience, supporting weather-sensitive sectors, and use the knowledge gained to train the next generation of scientists and engineers.  Met ireann said the research and development of AI models and techniques will enable it to build on its existing state-of-the-art forecasting capabilities.  This Professorship is an innovative and first-of-its-kind partnership for Met ireann, said Eoin Moran, Director of Met ireann.   In doing this, we are putting Met ireann at the forefront of technological developments that will shape national meteorological and hydrological services for years to come.  Not only is it a significant investment in the development of national forecasting capabilities and capacity but it will help make Ireland even more weather and climate prepared, by enhancing and improving the level of information available to the public.  We are hugely excited by the prospect of working closely with UCD, and of the potential opportunities this could lead to in the responsible use of AI for good.  The establishment of the Met ireann Research Professorship follows an international peer review process, through which UCDs application was selected based on its demonstration of excellence and impact, and its commitment to collaboration and knowledge transfer for the benefit of society and the economy.",14,1

I have a free Predictive CLV  Bayesian training (Jan st). Here's a glimpse of what's inside:  . Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a metric that represents the total net profit a company expects to earn from a customer throughout their entire relationship with the business. It's the most important number to a business.  . Why is it important: Without accurate CLV, you don't know what your ROI is for marketing. You don't know when customers are at the highest risk of leaving. You don't know how to segment using risk. And you constantly need to spend more to acquire new customers. Not good.  . Business Improvement using CLV Models: There are  types of CLV models. Historical and Predictive. I'll focus on Predictive because this is the most important to the business. Why? If you can't predict, then you can't make forward-looking decisions. And therefore your business improvement will be lower. Not using predictive CLV is a cost.  . Predictive Machine Learning CLV Case Study: Inside the workshop, I'll cover a full case study that looks individually at customers and predicts CLTV forward-looking. I'll demonstrate Bayesian techniques along with Machine Learning. No prior knowledge or prerequisites are required. I will use Python for the first workshop and R in the second.   Free Customer Lifetime Value Training:  What? Predictive Customer Lifetime Value with Bayesian in Python  When? Wednesday, January st at PM EST  How Much? How does free sound?

2024-01-16 10:31:00,lensiseethrough,"Astonishing revelation by ABridgen in this morning's today's Westminster Hall excess death debate:  It has been confirmed that UKHSA holds data on C vaccine dosage dates and deaths, data which is critical to establishing the absence, or otherwise, of a causal link between excess deaths and the vaccines.  UKHSA has apparently released this data to Pfizer, Moderna and Astra Zeneca, but it has refused to release the data to the public.  This is incredible. As ABridgen states:  ""They've released our health data to Big Pharma but they won't release it to us...is it really too much to ask that the British public be given the same level of access to the relevant data given to big pharma companies...""  And also:  ""The Covid Inquiry should be urgently looking at this issue instead they are wasting taxpayers' money... while people are dying...it is as if the Inquiry is so desperate not to find fault that they can't even look"".  It is clear from the number of attendees in the Hall and the tone and content of the comments being made (""there is far more demand to speak in this debate than there is time"" - miriamcates) that concern within Parliament is mounting.

2024-01-17 03:33:00,Necmttn,"Good morning, craftgenai and everyone!  In the past few days, I've been exploring how to create a JavaScript browser-based code interpreter.  Interestingly, I've noticed that AI agents share similarities with the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process in data science.  What is ETL?  . Extract relevant data from the source database  . Transform the data so it's better for analytics  . Load the data into the target database  . (It is not necessarily the job of the data engineer to query the data to get meaningful analytics.)  In the Scenario of an AI agent, we can replace Load with (Action, Reason)  How do these technologies map to agent workflows today?  With Custom GPTs, we have a preliminary implementation of this idea.  We can upload knowledge in different formats: PDFs, text files, CSV, you name it.  And with a Code Interpreter, we can transform that data blob into something meaningful. Even if it doesn't make sense to us at first.  Oh, sure. I totally have faith that the best AI will miraculously write the perfect piece of code to calculate the oh-so-specific data you desire effortlessly.  How could it possibly go wrong? Shortly, Many ways it can go wrong.  How can we improve LLM responses by combining fluid reasoning with a structured framework?  That's exactly what craftgenai is all about.  Imagine this: We already know that we can use LLMs to generate transformer codes. But what if we want a more readable approach for everyday people?  I can ask the AI agent to retrieve data for me. The AI agent has the ability to create a tool that utilizes available resources such as Shopify and googlesearchc to load data. It can also write smaller pieces of code to transform the data and organize it in a graph node structure that is easy to understand.  And can return us an ActionableReasonable response. We can go even further by providing tools to control resources, such as updating Shopify products and adding blog posts to enhance our SEO coverage.  What's even more remarkable is that once an AI agent creates a new tool or graph, it becomes a learned skill. The next time we ask similar questions, It won't need to reinvent the wheel; it will simply reuse the existing tools.  Exciting, right? If this resonates with you even a little bit, don't hesitate to follow craftgenai. The early access waitlist drops soon!",9,0

2024-01-17 02:18:00,PitheDoctor,"To understand the concept of ""nothing"" being ""something"" in the context of computer science, particularly with binary code (like """"), it's important to grasp the fundamental principles of how computers interpret data.  In binary code, which computers use to process and store data, each digit is a 'bit' and can be either  or . These are not representations of nothing and something in a literal sense but are symbolic representations used in binary logic:  . '' in Binary Code: It's often thought that '' represents 'nothing' in binary code. However, this is not entirely accurate. In binary code, '' is as much a value or 'something' as ''. It's an essential part of the binary system, representing one state of a binary digit.  . '' in Binary Code: Similarly, '' represents another state. It's not more significant than ''; it's just different.  . Concept of 'Nothing': In computing, the idea of 'nothing' can be more closely related to the absence of data or signal. However, even this 'absence' is represented within the confines of a binary system. For instance, null values or empty strings in programming represent the concept of 'nothing', but they are still part of the code.  . Binary Code """": This specific sequence is a combination of ''s and ''s, each bit representing a state. It's a meaningful pattern in binary logic and can represent different things depending on its context (for example, the number  in decimal).  So, in computer science, both '' and '' are something; they are states or conditions. 'Nothing', in the pure philosophical sense, doesnt exist in binary code. Even data that represents 'nothing' (like a null value) is still something within the system. This exemplifies the concept that in the realm of computers and programming, 'nothing' still has a form of existence as a state or a representation.",0,0

2024-01-16 21:38:00,neelfx,"It's pretty impressive. I asked it how it could theoretically make a positron brain (Data's brain from Star Trek TNG), here is the answer:  Designing a positronic brain is purely theoretical and based on the science fiction works of Isaac Asimov. In his Foundation series, he describes positronic brains as advanced artificial intelligence systems that can process information at incredible speeds. While creating such a device might not be feasible with current technology, we can explore how it could work conceptually.  . Structure: A positronic brain would likely have an intricate network of ""positronic pathways"" designed to handle the rapid transfer and processing of data. These pathways would consist of microscopic circuits made up of positron-based materials, allowing for high levels of efficiency and speed when compared to traditional electronic systems.  . Logic Units: The brain's logic units would process information based on Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics or any other set of rules that govern the behavior of an artificial intelligence. These laws would be hard-coded into the positronic pathways, ensuring that the robot behaves appropriately in various situations.  . Learning and Adaptation: A positronic brain could have self-learning capabilities through a process called ""positronic learning,"" which would enable it to adapt to new information and make decisions based on its experiences. This adaptation would be facilitated by feedback loops that constantly update the pathways to optimize performance.  . Memory Storage: The memory storage capacity of a positronic brain could be immense, with data stored in various levels ranging from short-term to long-term memories. Positronic brains might use a combination of holographic and molecular-scale data storage methods for maximum efficiency and speed when retrieving information.  . InputOutput Interfaces: A positronic brain would need sensory systems (sight, hearing, touch) as well as communication interfaces to interact with its environment. These inputoutput devices could be integrated into the artificial body housing the brain or connected externally for versatile functionality.  . Energy Requirements: To function effectively, a positronic brain would require an efficient energy source that can provide enough power without overheating or causing damage to the delicate circuits within the device. This may involve advanced cooling systems and energy storage solutions like superconductors or nanotechnology-based materials.  . Software Development: Developing software for a positronic brain would be crucial to ensure its functionality and adaptability. Programmers would need specialized tools, programming languages, and development environments designed specifically for positronics. This process could involve machine learning algorithms that help the AI system understand human language and behavior patterns better.  . Ethical Considerations: As with any artificial intelligence, there are significant concerns regarding the safety, security, and potential consequences of developing a fully functional positronic brain. These issues must be addressed through careful planning, regulation, and oversight to prevent unintended harm or misuse.  In summary, designing a positronic brain is an intriguing concept that combines advanced materials science, computer engineering, and software development to create an artificial intelligence system with incredible processing power. While this technology may not be feasible in the near future due to current technological limitations, exploring its theoretical principles can help guide future research and innovation in the field of AI and robotics",0,0

""The overall trend was extraordinarily positive and should be recognized as such,"" wrote analyst Jeff Asher in his end-of-year summary.  The U.S. is on track to end  with , homicides compared to , in . It's worth noting that these numbers would be substantially lower if Republicans would just support common sense gun laws.  Another analysis carried out by ABC News discovered that seven out of the ten largest American cities saw a double-digit decline. New York City dropped by , Los Angeles by , and Chicago by .  Meanwhile, conservative news outlets continue to run wall-to-wall propaganda claiming that Democratically-run cities are overrun with crime.   Unfortunately,  of Americans mistakenly believe that crime has spiked in the past year. Over half believe that crime has risen in their area.  ""In other words, tell your friends and family because they probably think crime is surging nationally. And in this case, theyre almost certainly wrong,"" stated Asher.

2024-01-16 19:48:00,mdancho84,"How do I scale k-Means Clustering?  . Sampling: chances are you dont need TB of data to find clusters. So I first sample to something more reasonable. Like M rows. Or maybe less.   . High Performance K-Means: Once I have a proof of concept done with a sample then Ill increase the scale. For this my go-to is HO Kmeans. Its high performance and much faster. You can also distribute it if needed.   And thats how I scale kmeans for companies.
